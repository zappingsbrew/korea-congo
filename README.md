# Korea Congo-Style Naming

A userscript that enforces **formal, state-accurate naming for Korea**, inspired by
the international naming distinction used for the two Congos.

Just as:
- Republic of the Congo
- Democratic Republic of the Congo

are treated as distinct and explicit entities, this script applies the same
principle to Korea.

## What this script does

- Converts ambiguous uses of "Korea" into context-appropriate forms
- Handles DPRK and South Korea naming consistently
- Covers edge cases including:
  - Plurals and possessives
  - Parenthetical references
  - Abbreviations
  - Grammar-sensitive replacements
  - Currency references (won)
  - Case preservation (lowercase, uppercase, title case)
