# Korea Congo-Style Naming

A userscript that enforces **formal, state-accurate naming for Korea**, inspired by
the international naming distinction used for the two Congos.

Just as:
- Republic of the Congo
- Democratic Republic of the Congo

are treated as distinct and explicit entities, this script applies the same
principle to Korea.

## What this script does

- Converts ambiguous uses of "Korea" into context-appropriate forms
- Handles DPRK and South Korea naming consistently
- Covers edge cases including:
  - Plurals and possessives
  - Parenthetical references
  - Abbreviations
  - Grammar-sensitive replacements
  - Currency references (won)
  - Case preservation (lowercase, uppercase, title case)

## Scope

This is **not** a simple word replacer.  
It operates on dynamically generated text, including search results and injected content.

## Installation

To use the **Korea Congo-Style Naming** userscript, follow these steps:

1. **Install a userscript manager** in your browser, such as:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

2. **Install the script**:
   - From **GitHub** (raw file):  
     [korea-congo.user.js](#) *(placeholder link for now)*
   - Or from **Greasy Fork** / **OpenUserJS** once published.

3. After installation, the script will automatically replace ambiguous references to Korea with context-appropriate naming when you visit websites.  
4. No additional configuration is required — it runs in the background and modifies text dynamically.

> ⚠️ The userscript only changes **displayed text locally in your browser**. It does **not** modify websites or collect personal data.
